Then, the sample was added to the extraction solution (tissues, cells and other samples need to be ground first) in a low-temperature environment for metabolite extraction treatment. Standard solutions of different concentrations were prepared. The standard solutions and the sample to be tested were subjected to LC-MS analysis under the same conditions. The detailed steps are as follows: 0.5*10^7 cells were combined with 4 μL of internal standard solution (containing 100 μg/mL L-Trp-D5, L-Gln-D5, and L-Lys-D4), 216 μL purified water and 25 μL of 0.15 % DOC.The mixed solution was sonicated (40 kHz) for 10 min at 5 °C, and then 5 μL of trichloroacetic acid (10 M) were added. Before centrifugation, the sample was stored at -20 °C for 10 min. Then the sample was centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 50 μL of supernatant was collected. 350 μL purified water were added, and then the mixed solution was filtrated by a PTFE filter (0.2 μm, biotage) for further analysis."

      "description": "Befere the collection, the cells were cultured on the surface of different substrates for 7 days as a treatment step. Ti means titanium foils which were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. (Tianjin, China). MT was fabricated from Ti via acid etching. Briefly, the titanium was sequentially treated with 3 wt% hydrofluoric acid at room temperature for 2 min and then immersed in 66 wt% sulfuric acid at 80 °C for 5 min. The obtained MT was rinsed thoroughly by ultrasonic. Subsequently, MT was immersed in 3 % APTES solution (toluene as solvent) for 24 h, and then washed thoroughly for further use. BPTES@MNT was obtained by one-step polymerization of dopamine. Briefly, MT-NH2 was placed in a mixed solution (VTris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 8.5): VDMSO = 1:1) containing dopamine (1 mg/mL), CaCl2 (0.05 mg/mL), BPTES (0.05 mg/mL) and 1 % APS. The reaction mixture was under continuous shaking (40 rpm) at room temperature overnight and avoid light. The obtained samples were rinsed thoroughly with DI water. Subsequently, PGA coating was modified on the substrate of BPTES@MNT by layer-by-layer method. In short, the samples were alternately immersed into Chi (0.5 w/v%) and PGA (1 w/v%) solution (two repeats). The samples were sterilized with ultraviolet irradiation or prepared under an aseptic environment for subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments."

In the AB Sciex quantitative software OS, the default parameters are used to automatically identify and integrate each ion fragment, with manual checks as an auxiliary. A linear regression standard curve is plotted with the mass spectrometry peak area of the analyte as the ordinate and the analyte concentration as the abscissa. Sample concentration calculation: The mass spectrometry peak area of the analyte in the sample is substituted into the linear equation to calculate the concentration result."

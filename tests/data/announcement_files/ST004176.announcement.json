      "description": "In this experiment, a certain mass of the sample was precisely measured. Then, the sample was added to the extraction solution (tissues, cells and other samples need to be ground first) in a low-temperature environment for metabolite extraction treatment. Standard solutions of different concentrations were prepared. The standard solutions and the sample to be tested were subjected to LC-MS analysis under the same conditions. The detailed steps are as follows: 0.5*10^7 cells were combined with 10 μL of internal standard solution (containing 5 μg/mL succinate-D4, 5 μg/mL L-carnitine-D3, 20 μg/mL cholicacid-D4 and 30 μg/mL salicylic acid-D4), 50 μL of methanol solution (methanol: water = 1:1, fisher) and 140 μL of acetonitrile. Then the mixed solution was vortexed for 1 min and sonicated for 30 min at 4 °C. After sonication, the sample was centrifuged at 14000 rcf for 20 min at 4 °C, and 100 μL of supernatant was collected. 25 μL of 3-NPH HCL (200 mM) and 25 μL of EDC HCL (120 mM, containing 6 % pyridine) were added, and then the mixed solution was vortexed for 30 s and placed into a constant temperature oscillator for 40 min at 60 °C. Finally, the sample was centrifuged at 14000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for analysis."

      "description": "Befere the collection, the cells were cultured on the surface of different substrates for 7 days as a treatment step. Ti means titanium foils which were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. (Tianjin, China). MT was fabricated from Ti via acid etching. Briefly, the titanium was sequentially treated with 3 wt% hydrofluoric acid at room temperature for 2 min and then immersed in 66 wt% sulfuric acid at 80 °C for 5 min. The obtained MT was rinsed thoroughly by ultrasonic. Subsequently, MT was immersed in 3 % APTES solution (toluene as solvent) for 24 h, and then washed thoroughly for further use. BPTES@MNT was obtained by one-step polymerization of dopamine. Briefly, MT-NH2 was placed in a mixed solution (VTris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 8.5): VDMSO = 1:1) containing dopamine (1 mg/mL), CaCl2 (0.05 mg/mL), BPTES (0.05 mg/mL) and 1 % APS. The reaction mixture was under continuous shaking (40 rpm) at room temperature overnight and avoid light. The obtained samples were rinsed thoroughly with DI water. Subsequently, PGA coating was modified on the substrate of BPTES@MNT by layer-by-layer method. In short, the samples were alternately immersed into Chi (0.5 w/v%) and PGA (1 w/v%) solution (two repeats). The samples were sterilized with ultraviolet irradiation or prepared under an aseptic environment for subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments."

The temperature was set to 550 °C, curtain gas was maintained at 35 psi, collision gas was set to medium, and both ion source gas 1 and 2 were set to 55 psi. Ion-spray voltage was set to 4500 V. In the Sciex quantitative software OS, the default parameters were used to automatically identify and integrate each ion fragment, with manual checks as an auxiliary. A linear regression standard curve was plotted using the ratio of the mass spectrometry peak area of the analyte to the internal standard peak area as the vertical coordinate and the concentration of the analyte as the horizontal coordinate. Sample concentration calculation: The ratio of the mass spectrometry peak area of the analyte to the internal standard peak area was substituted into the linear equation to calculate the concentration result."

  "title": "Retargeting azithromycin-like compounds as antimalarials with dual modality",
  "description": "Resistance to front-line antimalarials (artemisinin combination therapies) is spreading, and development of new drug treatment strategies to rapidly kill Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria are urgently needed. Here, we show that azithromycin—a clinically used macrolide antibiotic that targets the bacterium-like ribosome of the malaria parasites apicoplast organelle and causes a slow-killing ‘delayed death’ phenotype—can also rapidly kill parasites throughout the asexual blood-stages of the lifecycle via a ‘quick-killing’ mechanism of action. Investigation of 84 azithromycin analogues revealed nanomolar quick-killing potency that is directed against the very earliest stage of parasite development within red blood cells. Indeed, the best analogue exhibited 1600-fold higher potency than azithromycin for in vitro treatment windows less than 48 hours. Analogues were also effective against the zoonotic malaria parasite P. knowlesi, and against both multi-drug and artemisinin resistant P. falciparum lines. Metabolomic profiles of azithromycin analogue treated parasites were similar to those of chloroquine treated parasites, suggesting that the quick-killing mechanism of action may in part be localised to the parasite food vacuole. However, metabolomic signatures associated with mitochondrial disruption were also present. In addition, unlike chloroquine, azithromycin and analogues were active across blood stage development, including merozoite invasion, suggesting that these macrolides have a multi-factorial mechanism of quick-killing activity. The positioning of functional groups added to azithromycin and its quick-killing analogues altered their activity against bacterial-like ribosomes but had minimal change on quick-killing activity, which suggests that apicoplast-targeting, delayed-death activity can either be preserved or removed independently of quick-killing. Apicoplast minus parasites remained susceptible to both azithromycin and its analogues, further demonstrating that quick-killing is independent of apicoplast-targeting, delayed-death activity. Therefore, development of azithromycin and analogues as antimalarials offers the possibility of targeting parasites through both a quick-killing and delayed death mechanism of action in a single, multifactorial chemotype.",

Total run time was 32 min with an injection volume of 10 µL. Mass spectrometer was operated in full scan mode with positive and negative polarity switching at 35k resolution at 200 m/z, with detection range of 85 to 1275 m/z, AGC target was 1e6 ions with a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Electro-spray ionization source (HESI) was set to 4.0 kV voltage for positive and negative mode, sheath gas was set to 50, aux gas to 20 and sweep gas to 2 arbitrary units, capillary temperature 300 °C, probe heater temperature 120 °C.
